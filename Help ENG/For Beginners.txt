WELCOME TO NEXUS CORE, ROOKIE!

Coffee RES: "Relax, nothing's gonna explode... probably."

1. WHAT IS THIS?
This is the "Ghost Overlay" — a translucent window that floats above all other apps. Think of it as a futuristic HUD for your desktop.

2. HOW TO RUN?
- Drop 'jnativehook-2.2.2.jar' into the 'lib' folder. No jar, no magic.
- Double-click 'run.bat'.
- If a black console window appears, you're doing great.
- Press CTRL + F1 to witness the ghost.

3. WHY DO I NEED THIS?
To flex on your friends or create a custom dashboard that doesn't get in the way of your gaming.

4. CHANGING STUFF:
Click the "✦" symbol inside the overlay. Use the sliders to warp reality. 

TIP: If everything freezes, just close the console and restart run.bat. Coffee RES has your back!
