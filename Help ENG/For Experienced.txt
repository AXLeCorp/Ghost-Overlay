INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE WHO SPEAK CODE
--------------------------------------
Coffee RES: "Oh, so you know how to use Notepad++? Respect."

1. CHANGING HOTKEYS:
Locate the 'nativeKeyPressed' method in the code.
Swap 'VC_F1' for any other key from the JNativeHook library.
Example: VC_X or VC_SPACE.

2. ADDING YOUR OWN BUTTONS:
Find the 'initUI' method.
Copy the 'gearBtn' creation line and tweak the coordinates.
Use 'b.addActionListener' to make the button actually DO something (like launch a site or a script).

3. PARTICLE TUNING:
Find 'particles.add(new Particle(width, height))' at the start of the class.
Increase the loop count from 30 to 100 if you want a digital blizzard (and want to test your GPU's limits).

4. CUSTOM GRADIENTS:
Find 'LinearGradientPaint' in the 'paintComponent' method. You can input your own RGB colors there.
